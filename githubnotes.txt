Check git version :  git --version

        Introduce yourself to GIT(do it once)

                     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
                     git config --global user.email you@example.com
                     git config --global color.ui true


                    git init  ->
                    git status ->

                    git add filename
                    OR:
                    git add .


                    git commit -m "write you commit"



                    git push
                    git push -u origin master

                    git log - is another friend like git status

                       
                       
                    What is merge?
                    combine changes from different sources togather.
                 1) MERGE local version of the file with remote version of the file.
                 
                 
              how to bring white color to to our local Color.txt
              
             1) git pull (it a combination of fetch+merge)
             
             git fetch
             git merge
             
             
            fetch command => it will bring the changes / commits to local git repository. not in workspace yer, connot see in eclipse or intellij.
            
            
            git merge command ==> it will get commit from local repository to workspace.
             


1) commit all the changes locally first
2) pull and make sure you have all the commit in github
3) if there are any merge conflicts, solve them 
4) PUSH to remote



Best Practice:

        depending on how you use git, the above is good practice.
        
        to make it even beyyer, we should use branching in Git.
        
        
        
  ============================================
  
        when do merge conflict happen?
                whenever changes were made to same file and some exact line are different.
